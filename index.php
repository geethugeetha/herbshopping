<h2><b>HERBAL EXCHANGE</b></h2>
<p>We love herb businesses and herbalists.  These are people who really believe that plants offer themselves for food, medicine and just about everything and we only have to learn the plants' secrets.  And often herbalists are so  involved with the plants that they need some help in showing themselves off.  So we help.  We help our members grow herbs, market herbs and herbal products and be an herbalist successfully.  We know you can help your clients.  But we all need help promoting ourselves. 
Herb businesses are going great, but the ones that are doing well are those that are taking themselves seriously, and that means not feeling that the right people will find them.  They make themselves easy to find when people search for them on Google. 

Facebook, Instagram and other social media sites are fun, but Google doesn't index them completely.  And most people use Google to search for things no matter how you feel about them and who YOU use for your searches.   You shouldn't post that your dog recently died or vent about your mechanic as many on Facebook seem to do.  But what a great place to post a link to your blog or talk about your contribution on using herbs for hayfever.  (NEVER, NEVER state that herbs CURE anything if you sell herbs on the web unless you enjoy dealing with government agencies.)

Just a tip on improving your business and we all want people to use herbs because we truly believe that herbs make the difference.
